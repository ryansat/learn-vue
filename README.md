## Introduction to Vue.js

Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used to build user interfaces. This guide will walk you through the basics of Vue.js, including Vue instances, templates, directives, and more. 

## JavaScript ES6

Before diving into Vue.js, it's important to have a solid understanding of JavaScript, especially ES6 features. This section covers let, const, arrow functions, template literals, destructuring assignment, default parameters, the spread operator, rest parameters, promises, async/await, and modules.

## TypeScript Basics

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds static types, classes, interfaces, and other features. In this section, we cover the basics of TypeScript and how to use it in a Vue.js project.

## Getting Started with Yarn

Yarn is a powerful package manager for JavaScript. This section provides a beginner-friendly guide to Yarn, from installation to adding, upgrading, and removing dependencies.

## Introduction to Vite

Vite is a next-generation front-end build tool that offers significant improvements over older tools like Webpack. We'll look at how to set up a Vue 3 project using Vite and why Vite is a good choice for modern Vue.js development.
